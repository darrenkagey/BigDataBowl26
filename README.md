# Analyzing How Coverage Technique is Reflected by Post-Throw Movement
This is the code, visualizations, and written report that I submitted for the 2026 Big Data Bowl
My project focused on plays where defender(s) forced PBUs, analyzing how those defenders move when the ball was in the air, based on their coverage responsibility and the route that was targeted
Using exploratory visual and quantitative analysis, I wanted to see if patterns in these defenders movement when the ball is in the air at all reflected the techniques they are taught to play in specific coverages vs. certain routes
