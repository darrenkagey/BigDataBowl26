# Analyzing How Coverage Technique is Reflected by Post-Throw Movement
- This is the code, visualizations, and written report that I submitted for the 2026 Big Data Bowl
- My project focused on plays where defender(s) forced PBUs, analyzing how those defenders move when the ball was in the air, based on their coverage responsibility and the route that was targeted
- Using exploratory visual and quantitative analysis:
   - I determined if patterns in these defenders movement when the ball is in the air at all reflected the techniques they are taught to play in specific coverages vs. certain routes

## Repository Contents
- NFLBDB_Analytics.Rmd is the code I used to do all data cleaning, metric calculating, table building, and plot making, which outputs a interactive dashboard of defender's movement paths when the ball is in the air, split by coverage and route
- NFLBDB_Analytics.html is that interactive dashboard, the output of my code
- ProjectData holds all the external data files I had to upload into r for my code
- ProjectVisuals holds all the Visuals/Tables that either my code produced or I made elsewhere and inserted into my written report
- BDB Report w/Visuals is my written report for this project
